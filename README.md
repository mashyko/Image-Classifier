#1 Image-Classifier for Tensorflow

To implement the notebooks using Keras + Tensorflow 2.0,
 the image data is required , so that image data, such as elephant.jpg,  must be uploaded and located in the 'images' directory: 
 setting the image_path below:
 
img_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/images/elephant.jpg'

or

!git clone https://github.com/mashyko/Image-Classifier/


#2 Image Classification for Pytorch

 Cifar_pytorch.ipynb,and  alex_cufar10.ipynb
 just run the notebook on the Google Colab.

# Transfer learning or Fine tuning codes for Pytorch

transfer_learning_resnet.ipynb, transfer_learning_vgg.ipynb, torchvision_finetuning_Mask_R-CNN.ipynb, and finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.ipynb

 just run the notebook on the Google Colab. notebooks above are supposed to load data online.
