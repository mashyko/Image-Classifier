# Image-Classifier for Tensorflow

To implement the notebooks using Keras + Tensorflow 2.0,ã€€such as 

  InceptionV3.ipynb, VGG_ResNet50.ipynb, MobileNet.ipynb,

the image data is required so that it  must be uploaded and located in the 'images' directory.

 !git clone https://github.com/mashyko/Image-Classifier/ and just run the notebooks,


# Image Classification for Pytorch

 pytorch_AlexNet.ipynb, image_classifier_vgg_pytorch.ipynb, Cifar_pytorch.ipynb,and  alex_cifar10.ipynb
 
 just run the notebook on the Google Colab.

# Transfer learning or Fine tuning codes for Pytorch

transfer_learning_resnet.ipynb, transfer_learning_vgg.ipynb, torchvision_finetuning_Mask_R-CNN.ipynb, and finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.ipynb

 just run the notebook on the Google Colab. notebooks above are supposed to load data online.
